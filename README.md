What you will need to run the project:
- Python 3.6
- Pip 9.0.1
- Django 2.2.7
- Channnels 2.3.1

Notes:
This project uses [Redis.io](https://redis.io)

Steps:
0. Please make sure that you have python 3.6 and pip 9.0.1 by typing `python3 --version` and `pip3 --version` into the command line. If either are not installed please install them.
1. Install Channels by typing `pip3 install -U channels` into the command line. This may take a few minutes and should install Django as well. You can check if Django is installed by typing `django-admin.py version` into the command line. If this doesn't print the version number you will have to install Django seperately.
- If Django was not installed, download it by typing `pip install Django==2.2.7`. This process will take a few minutes.
